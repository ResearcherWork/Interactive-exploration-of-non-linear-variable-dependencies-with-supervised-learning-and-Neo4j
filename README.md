# Interactive-exploration-of-non-linear-variable-dependencies-with-supervised-learning-and-Neo4j
In this work we focus on temporal data and we propose a new approach aiming at making data more comprehensive. Our approach makes use of two well-known supervised learning techniques: decision trees and model trees. We used these two tools and the graph platform Neo4j to detect and explore non-linear dependencies between datasets variables. This is achieved by creating a dependency graph between these variables and displaying it through an interactive graphical interface easy to manipulate by the user. Our experiments were conducted on a typical usual benchmark and showed the dependency relationships between its variables.
